Create the GameManager Class with “: MonoBehaviour”:
1. Attach GameManager to a game object in your Unity scene.
2. In the Start() method:
a. Instantiate two Player objects.
b. Call InitializePlayer() to set playerName and health for each
Player object.
c. Use both versions of the Heal() method to demonstrate method
overloading.
d. Call ShowPlayerCount() to display the total number of Player
objects.

Finally, push both Player.cs and GameManager.cs scripts to your GitHub
repository and provide the link to each script.
